# **Dask vs Pandas Scalability**

## **Project Overview**
This project demonstrates the scalability of Dask over Pandas when analyzing large datasets in Python. We compare the performance of both tools on synthetic datasets of increasing size (1M, 10M, 50M rows) and evaluate how they handle grouping and aggregation tasks.

## **Dataset Generation**

Synthetic datasets were generated with the following structure:
- id: Unique identifier
- value: Random float between 0 and 1
- category: Random choice from ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
